# **Workshop on *The Art of Compressing LLMs*: Pruning, Distillation, and Quantization Demystified (1st Edition)**

### **Co-located with the 28th International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR 2026)**

**Location:** Lyon, France  
**Dates:** August 21–22, 2026

***

## **Overview**

As Large Language Models (LLMs) grow in complexity, the computational cost of inference and training has become a significant barrier for the Pattern Recognition and HPC communities.  
This workshop explores the art and engineering of compressing these models to make them cheaper, faster, and easier to deploy while strictly preserving practical capability.

We move beyond pure theory to demonstrate how pruning and quantization interact with actual hardware constraints on the NVIDIA stack. Participants will engage with foundational concepts and advanced implementation patterns designed to maximize GPU utilization and reduce end-to-end time-to-solution.

***

## **Topics of Interest**

We invite practitioners and researchers to explore a range of topics centered on model efficiency, including:

*   ML Model Optimization
*   Large Language Models (LLMs) and Generative AI in HPC
*   Pruning, Quantization, and Knowledge Distillation techniques
*   Hardware constraints and real-world production workloads
*   Industrial use cases of HPC, ML, and deep learning

***

## **Workshop Goals**

*   **Demystify Compression:** Bridge the gap between theoretical research and practical hardware application.
*   **Enable Efficient Deployment:** Equip the community with actionable "recipes" and design trade-offs for immediate implementation.
*   **Skill Building:** Provide strategies to improve node-level throughput and maximize hardware efficiency.

***

## **Format & Schedule**

This is a **Full-Day Workshop**.  
The agenda is modular and includes specialized lab sessions designed to provide hands-on experience with compression implementation.

*   **Workshop Dates:** August 21–22, 2026 (following the main ICPR conference)
*   **Format:** In-person (Lyon, France)
